# Chicago-Alderman-Election-Analysis
A simple code to grab aldermanic election data from the Chicago Democracy Project. This code utilizes the tidyverse, Rselenium, and rvest packages to scrape a dataset off of the Chicago democracy Project website (http://chicagodemocracy.org/ChooseElection.jsp). The goal of this web scraping code is to develop a dataset that is usable to run a variety of regression models to analyze the impact of incumbency advantage on aldermanic elections. 
A data analysis file with a few CSV files are included for replicating the figures and models specified in the writing sample that this is a part of. For the data analysis and figure creation the libraries ggplot2, stargazer, and lmtest, are used.
